## 🚀 About Me

<div style="text-align: justify; width=75%">
I am Kartikeyan, a passioante coder with a thing for implementing pretty much anything that is challenging to code up. I mainly try to convert the knowledge I gain into a code based implementation. You'll find alot of repos which contain self made libraries encomapassing the knowledge I've gained.<br><br>

I am also an anime enthusiast and devote a little too much time for that as well, you're welcome to discuss that with me
anytime. I'll always have something for you.
