## ðŸš€ About Me

<div style="text-align: justify; width=75%">
I am Kartikeyan Iyer, a graduate from IIT Kanpur (IITK Y20 batch) from the dept of Electrical Engineering (EE).<br>
I enjoy my time learning about machinery, any machinery infact, including softwares, libraries and packages, what I have been
into recently. You'll find alot of repos which contain self made libraries encomapassing the knowledge I've gained.<br><br>

I am also an anime enthusiast and devote a little too much time for that as well, you're welcome to discuss that with me
anytime. I'll always have something for you.
