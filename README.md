## ðŸš€ About Me

<div style="text-align: justify; width=75%">
I am Kartikeyan Iyer, currently a recent graduate from IIT Kanpur (IITK Y20 batch). I enjoy my time learning about recent trends in Deep Learning and applying them in domain specific problems.<br>
I am pretty average when it comes to being active in any form of social media and a certified noob when it comes to GitHub, but that won't stop me from posting my projects here. <br>
I get into an obsession when it comes to linear algebra, hence my obsession to develop a library of linear algebra subroutines and learning the algos that go along with it. 
I'm also an advocate of building things from scratch, hence a bunch of projects which deal with that.
